This a project implement the paper 'Color Transfer between Images' by Erik Reinhard, Michael Ashikhmin, etc, on openCV and C++. However, basically implement the method in the paper doesn't make results as good as the paper's. Therefore, to get better result, I try to do some optimization.  
Notice that the implementation is under windows, so user should modify the path name in the codes to work well in other environments.
